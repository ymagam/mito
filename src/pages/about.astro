        Mitochondros is a space for exploring the systems that power ideas, the patterns
        that shape thinking, and the energy that drives meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the organelles that generate cellular energy, this blog examines the core
        mechanisms behind creativity, design, and building with intention. We focus on
        clarity, structure, and the quiet power of well-considered systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a place for reading and reflection, not distraction. No newsletters,
        no tracking, no interruptions. Just thoughtful writing.
